This app serves your organization's events in a single place. You can view events, create new events, add participants
and set reminders. Reminders will pop up event the app isn't running, so you won't miss out any event.

Project itself is self-hostable. You can deploy it to any server you want. You will own your own data - not someone else,
even us.

You can see the server software of this application [here.](https://github.com/berkakkaya/calendar_app_server)
